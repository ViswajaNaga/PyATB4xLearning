# Literals(Variable value)
# variable is a container that stores the value
# Variable name(Identifier)
# = (operator)--Assignment operator
# variable value(Literal)
# Ex: age=65
age = 65
print(age)
age = age + 1
print(age)
age + 2  # here it is not stored after increment so answer is 66
print(age)

# DataTypes
# Basic = Int, Float, str, Bool, complex
# Advanced = List, Tuple, set, dict, Frozenset, NoneType
# Pyhon OrderedDictionary....

# Python is dynamically typed Language--> Literals value determine the datatype
age = 65  # int
is_married = True  # bool
name = "Viswaja"  # str
# decimal system --> base 10
# binary system --> base 2
# Octal system --> base 8
# Hexadecimal System --> base 16
Binary = 0b1010  # 10
Octal = 0o130  # 88
hexa = 0x12c
